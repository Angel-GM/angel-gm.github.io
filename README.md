# Personal Website
A Jekyll-based page generator based on the repo https://robhinds.github.io

A few years agao I helped create a devloper CV webapp that let users sign up and connect lots of online footprints to make a dynamic online CV (formerly nerdability.com, now parked at: http://nerdability.github.io/ ), and I thought why not just create a static site generated version that re-created the user profile CV.  Luckily, GitHub provides native support for Jekyll sites as part of its user pages (https://{{yourusername}}.github.io), so as well as hosting the Jekyll project on GitHub, it also automatically builds and serves the site for you on a nice share-able URL.
